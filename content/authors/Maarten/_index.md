I am an Assistant Professor at the Psychological Methods Unit of the University of Amsterdam and Principal Investigator of the Bayesian Graphical Modeling project. My work combines psychometric theory with Bayesian inference and computational methods, focusing on Bayesian analysis of psychological data in general and graphical network models in particular.
