I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Psychological Methods Unit of the University of Amsterdam. I am working on the development of Bayesian methods for model selection and inference on psychometric data using Bayesian Graphical Models (BGMs). Particularly, I am implementing MCMC methods and novel computational techniques to analyze BGMs.
My other research interests include (longitudinal) social network models, time-sensitive methods for modeling the influence of social interactions, network models for biological and genetic processes. I am also passionate about programming, improving code efficient and solving mathematical optimization problems.
